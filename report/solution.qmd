This report documents your implementation of Fisher randomization p-values and Neyman inference with statistic and weighting variants.

Run `python scripts/run_pipeline.py` from the project root. The pipeline must first map `input` to `cleaned` and then map `cleaned` to `output`. Use `output/results.json` to populate the following tables.

## 2. Fisher p-value variants

| statistic_variant | pvalue |
|---|---:|
| difference_in_means | |
| studentized | |
| stratified_size_weighted | |
| stratified_equal_weighted | |

## 3. Neyman inference under different weights

| weight_scheme | tau_hat | se_hat | ci_lower | ci_upper |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| size_weighted | | | | |
| equal_weighted | | | | |

## 4. Brief interpretation

The p-values and confidence intervals differ across statistic and weight choices because each design emphasizes different parts of the outcome distribution and stratum composition.
